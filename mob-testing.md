#### Joep Schuurkes & Elizabeth Zagroba

## Why add another meeting to your life?

===

### Issues in search of a solution

- Uneven distribution of testing expertise 
 - lowering the Joep bus/conference factor
 - no shared training baseline (RST, BBST, ISTQB, etc.)
- Constant team changes, growth, and reshuffling
 - lacked a sense of community and cooperation
 - insufficient knowledge about the products we support
- Test Guild stayed as one big meeting
 - wanted to work together on something

## A radical experiment: 
## mob testing

===

### What is a mob?

### Why mob?

===

### How do you mob?
- ideas have to be put into words before they can be put into the computer
- communicate at the highest level of abstraction: 
 - intention, location, implementation
- four-minute rotations, shorter when things aren't flowing
- kindness, consideration, and respect
- yes, and...
- bias to action

===

### Our plan
- just Online Platform teams (not AppDev or Cloud)
- once a week for an hour and a half
- cast of characters:
 - one driver (controls mouse and keyboard)
 - one navigator (decides our next step)
 - any extra people are the mob
 - one oracle/facilitator 
- opening decision about what to explore/writing a charter
- sometimes call in a more knowledgeable oracle towards the end

===

### The Trello board
<a href="https://trello.com/b/NzZvsl41/mob-testing-session-ideas" target="_blank"><img src="trello-board.png" width="30%"/></a>

- sometimes tickets from the current sprint
- most often weird adjacent non-blocking issues

===

### Summary
- weekly sessions since end of February
- more learning than testing
 - lots of product knowledge shared
 - troubleshooting around particular topics has improved
 - note-taking skills improving across the testers
 - learn all the OS'es
- more mature mob => less strict navigating
- good energy during the sessions
- more community feeling and collaborative problem-solving outside of the sessions

===

### Room for improvement
- taking notes [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Mobtesting)
- not making decisions as the driver
- building on each other's ideas
- move our communication to a higher level
 - share more intentions
- whoever shows up are the right people
 - rarely got priority over release testing
 - little to no interest from other people in the unit
