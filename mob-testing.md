# mob testing:<br/>building good habits
#### Joep Schuurkes & Elizabeth Zagroba
#### 6 February 2020 European Testing Conference

Notes: 
CONTEXT

===

<!-- .slide: class="section-title" -->
## getting started

===

### the invite

<< @joep: dig up what the outlook invite looked like >>

Notes: 
- people showed up, except Marijn
- whoever shows up are the right people

===

### historical context

Mobbing at Mendix was following a script during a meeting.
- demonstration rather than exploration

Notes:
- next step after same people, time, place => computer

===

### initial goals

- more even distribution of testing expertise 
- lowering the bus/conference factor
- start from a shared baseline of knowledge
- shape a sense of community and cooperation
- work on something together
- build knowledge about the products we support and the tools we use

Notes: 
- knowledge-sharing among participants
- Woody found mobbing as a solution to these issues
@ez maybe an image and fewer words?

===

<!-- .slide: class="section-title" -->
## how we mob

===

### how we mob
- ideas have to be put into words before they can be put into the computer
- communicate at the highest level of abstraction: 
 - intention, location, implementation
- four-minute rotations
- kindness, consideration, and respect
- bias to action
- yes, and...

Notes: 
- new mobs just end up talking
- example of intention, location, implementation
- Woody's mob with different roles didn't insist on taking the keyboard
@ez too many words on this slide => two slides, or pare it down and just say more?

===

### roles in a mob

<br/><a href="https://mobprogrammingguidebook.xyz/" class="caption">Used with permission (pending) from the Mob Programming Guidebook by Maaret Pyhäjärvi</a>

Notes: 
- @ez Ask Maaret for permission to use this image
- enabling constraints
- how tight/loose to stick to roles/rules
- ability to step away

===

### participants & setup

<< @ez Take picture at a mob session in Jan >>

Notes:

- bullying for people who normally show up
- describe personalities/skill levels
- rotate mouse and keyboard
- mobbing with only juniors would not be as effective
- puts communication problems under the microscope

- Joep, facilitator in our mob
- amplify but not take away their force
- call out missed contributions
- actively listening to what they mean vs. what they say

===

### our Trello board
<a href="https://trello.com/b/NzZvsl41/mob-testing-session-ideas" target="_blank"><img src="images/Trello-board.png" width="20%"/></a>

Notes:
- sometimes test on prod
- anyone can add, adder brings machine
- mob chooses together which to pick up
- sometimes tickets from the current sprint
- most often weird adjacent non-blocking issues

===

### numbers

- 12 months
- 11 Mendix products explored
- 90-minute sessions every week
- about 45 sessions 
- 3 operating systems shared
- about a million times asked for a different level of abstraction

Notes:
- @ez Outlook fact-check needed on session and bug numbers, also can't figure out why the bullets are centered just on this slide

## lessons we learned

===

### simply the best

<br/><a href="https://mobprogrammingguidebook.xyz/" class="caption">Used with permission (pending) from the Mob Programming Guidebook by Maaret Pyhäjärvi</a>

Notes: 
@ez Ask Maaret for permission to use this image
- mistakes get corrected in the moment
- cost of delays in knowledge are usually hidden

===

### learning > outcomes

- provide a space where learning can happen, <br/>and it will
- very few bugs found
- very few notes taken
- very small charter scope

Notes: 
- make it as easy as possible to be the best you can be
- generative != productive, how others do tasks

===

### sessions that didn't lead to learning

- facilitate one session for another team
- have new member join one of our sessions
- stuck in a rabbit hole
- yak-shaving setting up someone's machine

===

### tips to promote learning

- have a charter specific enough to decide if you're deviating from it
- stick with it, habits take longer to build
- in doing the work, we discover what work we must do

Notes:
- nobody thinks mobbing is useful after just one session
- example of Data Hub instructions session

===

### retros

- without retros, plateau after a few sessions
- positive/reinforcing retros


Notes:
- reinforcing retro goes back to:
 - kindness, consideration, and respect
 - bias to action
 - yes, and...

===

<!-- .slide: class="section-title" -->
## habits

===

### habits we built

- hold on to strong-style communication outside the mob
 - reach out to each other for help
- troubleshooting around particular topics has improved
 - read the error message

Notes:
- catching yourself quickly when not acting in line with the habit
- good energy during the sessions
- more community feeling and collaborative problem-solving outside of the sessions

===

### habits we're still building

- taking notes ([Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Mobtesting))
- not making decisions as the driver
- building on each other's ideas
- move our communication to a higher level
 - share more intentions
- whoever shows up are the right people

Notes:
 - trying ideas instead of discussing them
 - rarely got priority over release testing
 - little to no interest from other people in the unit
 - when Llewellyn leaves, most of the teams don't continue mobbing

===

## recap

===

### recap 
- whoever are there are the right people
- this stuff is hard, stick with it
- have a facilitator focused on the process
- turn up the good in retros
- learning _is_ the productivity, part of the job


===

<!-- .slide: class="section-title" -->
## thanks.

find us at the rest of the conference to ask questions and share thoughts.
